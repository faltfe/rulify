## What is rulify? ü§î

Some time ago I had the challenge of mapping a some business rules into code. I
was not satisfied with existing libraries because they were either to complex
and had to many features or the implementation was not intuitiv for me. That was
the birth of _rulify_.

_rulify_ itself is a library that provides a framework for implementing
business rules as code. A rule is an abstract representation of exactly one 
condition, which is followed by an action. In other words, a rule describes 
an _if-then_ structure.

The special feature of _rulify_ is that both conditions and actions can be
created independently of the rule, so that they can be reused several times in
different rules.

** ‚Äº The library does not claim to fulfil the criteria of a rule engine, 
nor to replace it. ‚Äº**

## How _rulify_ works? üî®

_rulify_ offers two classes which can be used as a start for the implementation
of a rule.

1. A `Rule` will evaluate a `Condition` and perform the provided `Action`
2. An `Effect` will evaluate a `Condition`, modify the data with the given
   `Modifier` and run lastly the provided `Action`.

A `Rule` or `Effect` always works with data provided by your own implementation.
This data must be managed by a single object, which is ideally a POJO.

## How to get started with _rulify_? üéÜ

All you need is a POJO and a custom implementation of a `Rule` or a `Effect`
and implement the mandatory methods. Let's say there is our POJO `Cat` that
looks like

```java
public class Cat {

    // Setter and Getter omitted for simplicity
    private String name = "Meow üê±";
    private boolean cute;

    public Cat(boolean isCute) {this.cute = isCute;}

    public boolean isCute() {return cute;}

    public void purr() {System.out.println("üêà + ", name);}
}
```

Now we need your `CatRule` which will evaluate a business rule and execute a 
defined action.

```java
public class CatRule extends Rule<Cat> {

    @Override
    public Cat data() { // <- provide an object to work with
        return new Cat(true);
    }

    @Override
    public Condition<Cat> condition() { // <- this is our business rule
        return Cat::isCute; // -> uses object provided at data()
    }

    @Override
    public Action<Cat> action() { // <- what should happen
        return Cat::purr; // -> prints "üêà Meow üê±"
    }
}
```

The last part is to execute the `Rule`.

```java
public class MyRuleExecutor() {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Executable rule = new CatRule();
        rule.execute();
    }
}
```

If the data should be manipulated or a side effect is needed replace 
`Rule<Cat>` with `Effect<Cat>`. The image below shows the different flows 
between a `Rule` and an `Effect`.

## What are the benefits of _rulify_?

The first and main advantage of this library compared to what actually? In my
opinion, there two groups to which _rulify_ can be compared.

### Benefits compared to plain If-Then implementations

At first glance, using rulify seems significantly more complicated than an
If-Else-Then construct. For simple conditions it is true, but as soon as things
get more complex, the strengths of rulify come to the fore.

1. A rule is reusable.
2. There is a separation between the components condition and execution. It 
   is easy to implement SOLID this way.
3. The individual components are easier to test.

### Benefits compared to any rule engine

As mentioned before a rule engine is much more complex than this library
because _rulify_ aims another target. The main target is to provide a better
mechanism for If-Then conditions.

# Rulify runner üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

> **Warning: The rulify runner was rewritten. The documentation is outdated.**

A second library provides mechanism to scan a project for rules and execute the
connected `Rule` or `Effect`. At the moment

- Java SE
- Java EE 8
- Jakarta (Java 11)

are supported. Spring Boot is not supported yet, because it uses an own
annotation scanner.

## How to start with rulify runner?

_rulify runner_ provides an API with the interface `RulifyRunner` that has the
method `run()`. Each implementation for a specific platform should implement
this method.

The first step is to annotate any class with `@Rule(MyRule.class)` and provide a
marker interface that extends `Executable`. The next step is to configure the
runner. The `rulify runner` needs to know which packages should be scanned. Each
runner instance can scan exactly one package recursively.

For Java SE projects this will look like

```java
RulifyRunner runner = new RuleRunner("de.faltfe.rulify");
runner.run();
```

and for Java projects that uses dependency injection

```java
@Inject @RulifyConfig(path = "de.faltde.rulify") private RulifyRunner runner;

public void run(){
    runner.run();
}
```
